# MH aWHEREness

MH aWHEREness is the viewing and crowdmapping platform for the mental health awhereness project.

This was initially based on Raphael Dumas' repository - [crowdmap-basic](https://github.com/radumas/crowdmap-basic).

Updated with more plugins and functions to make crowdmapping of mental health services and facilities easier even for non-GIS/non-mapping volunteers.

Platforms and Libraries Used:
- [Leaflet Draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw)
- [Carto](https://carto.com/)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
